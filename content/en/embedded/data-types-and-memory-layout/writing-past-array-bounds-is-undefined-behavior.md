## Short answer

<span class="warn">`arr[10]` has undefined behavior.</span> For `int arr[10]`, valid indices are `0..9`.[^iso-c-n1570]

The program may crash, corrupt data, or appear to work; it is not guaranteed to overwrite a neighboring local or return address because object placement varies by implementation.[^iso-c-n1570]

Use AddressSanitizer where supported and check the index before access.[^iso-c-n1570]
