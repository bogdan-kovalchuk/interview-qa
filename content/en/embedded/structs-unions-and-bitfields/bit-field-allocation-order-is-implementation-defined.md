## Short answer

<span class="warn">No: the allocation order of bit-fields within a storage unit is implementation-defined.</span>

One compiler may place the first field in the least significant bits; another compiler or a different ABI may behave differently. Endianness also does not give a simple portable rule for bit-field layout within bytes.

Defence: do not use bit-fields as a wire format between different compilers/targets. For protocol bits use masks/shifts over an integer obtained from explicitly parsed bytes.[^iso-c-n1570]
