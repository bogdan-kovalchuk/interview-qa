## Short answer

<span class="warn">These are completely different types.</span>

`void (*f)(void)` – variable `f` is a pointer to function returning void. `void *f(void)` – function `f` that takes nothing and returns `void *`.

To distinguish them, start reading the declaration at the name and move outward through its parentheses.[^iso-c-n1570]
