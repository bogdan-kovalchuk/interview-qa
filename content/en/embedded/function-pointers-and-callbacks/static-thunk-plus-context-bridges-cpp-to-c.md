## Short answer

Use a static thunk plus a context pointer.

`static void thunk(void *ctx, uint8_t b) { static_cast<App *>(ctx)->on_rx(b); }` `uart_register(thunk, this);`

A static member function has no hidden `this` and is compatible with a plain function pointer if the signature matches. `ctx` restores the object instance manually.

Rule: this is the standard bridge between a C HAL and C++ class design.[^embeddedinterviewlab]
