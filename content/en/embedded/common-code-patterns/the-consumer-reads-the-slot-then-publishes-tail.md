## Question code

```c
static inline bool rb_get(ringbuf_t *rb, uint8_t *b) {
  if (rb->head == rb->tail) return false; // empty
  *b = rb->buf[rb->tail];
  rb->tail = (rb->tail + 1) & RB_MASK;
  return true;
}
```

## Short answer

**Consumer reads data, then updates `tail` last.**

`head == tail` means empty. Read the `tail` slot, then advance `tail` with the mask. Only the consumer touches `tail`.

Rule: the producer owns `head`, the consumer owns `tail`; neither side writes the other’s index.[^embeddedinterviewlab]
