## Short answer

<span class="warn">Padding and alignment depend on the compiler, architecture, and build options.</span>

The same code on M4 and PowerPC may have different field offsets, while endianness determines the byte order of multi-byte values. So "the same .h file" ≠ "the same byte format".

Defense: do not assume two compilers have compatible layouts without checking; define an explicit wire format and serialize field by field.[^iso-c-n1570]
