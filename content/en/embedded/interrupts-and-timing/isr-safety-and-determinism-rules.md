## Short answer

**ISR** is an interrupt service routine, code executed in response to a hardware/software interrupt. It must be short, deterministic, non-blocking, with no heap or long locks, and minimal shared state. Typical pattern: clear the interrupt flag, take/post minimal data, notify a task or the main loop.[^dou-embedded-interview]
