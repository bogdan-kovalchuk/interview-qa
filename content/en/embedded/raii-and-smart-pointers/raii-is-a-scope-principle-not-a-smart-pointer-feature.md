## Short answer

<span class="warn">RAII is a scope-lifetime principle, not about smart pointers.</span>

Lock guard, interrupt guard, scoped handle live on the stack and manage no pointer at all – this is full RAII. A smart pointer is just one application of the idea.

Defense: think of RAII as ctor acquires, dtor releases, not as `unique_ptr`.[^embeddedinterviewlab]
