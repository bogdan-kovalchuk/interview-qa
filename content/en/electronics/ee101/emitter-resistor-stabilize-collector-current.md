    kind: book
    version: null
    applicability: "Textbook, section 5.3: two-supply emitter bias, I_C = (|V_EE| - V_BE)/(R_E + R_B/β); if R_E is much larger than R_B/β, β plays virtually no role in I_C; V_C = V_CC - I_C*R_C. The 1 % figure applies only to this example's values."

    kind: book
    version: null
    applicability: "Textbook, section 2.2: the Shockley equation for a p-n junction; current depends exponentially on voltage; the saturation current rises with temperature and the curve shifts left when heated (more current at the same voltage). Describes a diode, not a transistor."

    kind: book
    version: null
    applicability: "Textbook, section 4.5: the simplified Ebers-Moll model; β depends on the device, temperature, I_C and V_CE. In the base bias with fixed I_B, doubling β doubles I_C. Gives no data for a specific device."
