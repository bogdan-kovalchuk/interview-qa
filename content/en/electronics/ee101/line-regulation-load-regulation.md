    version: "SLVA079, October 1999"
    applicability: "Defines line regulation as ΔV_o/ΔV_i and load regulation as ΔV_o/ΔI_o for LDOs, notes that both are steady-state parameters distinct from transient response, and that a higher open-loop gain improves them. The report is about LDOs; for other regulator types datasheet definitions may use other units and conditions."

    version: "Rev. 3.0, 7 June 2023"
    applicability: "The dynamic resistance of a Zener diode R_dyn = ΔV_Z/ΔI_Z is larger than zero, the differential resistance r_dif as the steepness of the V_Z–I_Z curve, and the simple regulator with a series resistor R1; data are for Nexperia series, other manufacturers can have other numbers. The note does not derive line/load regulation formulas."

    accessed: 2026-10-06
    kind: book
    version: null
    applicability: "The simple Zener regulator: the current of the series resistor is split between the load and the Zener diode, and when the load current is too large the Zener diode stops conducting, regulation is lost and the resistor and load form a voltage divider. The book gives no line/load regulation formulas."
